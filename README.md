# Imagini-Reddit-Image-Downloader
Reddit Image Downloader API

Designed to download images from reddit en-masse from specific subreddits.
Tested downloading 1000 images from 'startrekmemes', suceeded in 0:51. Evidently, it is quite fast.

To use, one must have python 3.4.0 or higher installed on WINDOWS. Linux has not been tested and may or may not work.
Contact me if you have a working linux system and are willing to help with development.

 - First, make sure all listed modules are installed, and then enter your Reddit Bot UID stuff in the places inside the program that ask for it.

 - cd to your program location

 - Run in your preferred terminal.
 
 - Profit!
